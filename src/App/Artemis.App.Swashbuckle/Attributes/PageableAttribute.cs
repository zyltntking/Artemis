///     The REST API guidelines define a common pattern for paging through lists of data.
///     The operation response is modeled in OpenAPI as a list of items (a "page") and a link to the next page,
///     effectively resembling a singly linked list. Tag the operation as x-ms-pageable and the generated code will
///     include methods for navigating between pages.
